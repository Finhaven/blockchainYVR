BlockchainYVR a blockchain / DLT agnostic meetup that is focused on people developing projects. Roughly this means "developers", or at least people aware & experienced with technical product building. Designers, product leads, and anyone involved in developing the code and products in this space are welcome.

## What are the goals?

* opportunity for the people building blockchains, dapps, and decentralized tech to share and learn from each other
* provide a (virtual) space where the local community can gather
* encourage people to work together on apps & products of all kinds
* promote items of interest to our participants

## What is it not?

* Blockchain 101: we _do_ want to support people learning to code, but we _don't_ focus on conceptual basics
* A Lecture series: while members may choose to organize talks and lectures, we want to focus on non "lecture" content; we want to learn together, have everyone be a participant, and highlight demos, running code, and learning
